## To Improve the Mental Health of Everyone 
  Having graduated with a degree in Biology, I had taken a few classes and over time become more aware of the importance not just of physical health but mental health. It is an aspect of one's well-being that is all too often neglected or overlooked. For my first class on Android Development, our final project was to create an app that would help improve someone's daily life. Hearing that, I immediately knew the direction I wanted to take my project. I knew it would be a daunting task, requiring plenty of thinking to implement features I had never done (a chat system and a tab based app with location services), but it would be worth it if I could actually one day help someone with my budding App Development skills. Even though I wasn't able to fully complete the app before my class ended, I hope to be able to improve the app over time and maybe one day release it.
  
## Future Changes
- Update chat system
- Update Location Services
